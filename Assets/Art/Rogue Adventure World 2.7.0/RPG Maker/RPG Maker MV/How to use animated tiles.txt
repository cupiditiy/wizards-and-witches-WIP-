Dear valued customer,

Thank you for purchasing my asset pack!
Rogue Adventure animated tiles contains 4 frames, which are looped through the 
directions of the sprite not a stepping event.
To use the animated tiles, create one event, select the animated sprite that you
want to use, at "Autonomous Movement" set "Type: Custom" and "Freq: 5: Highest".
Now let's set the "Route..." as the following:

Turn Down 
Wait 15ms
Turn Left
Wait 15ms
Turn Right 
Wait 15ms
Turn Up
Wait 15ms

Don't forget to tick "Repeat Movements" so the animation keep playing.
A screenshot has been added for reference.

Have fun! 

Best regards,
ElvGames
